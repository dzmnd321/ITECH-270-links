<h1>My Favorite Things</h1>

            <h3>K-pop</h3>
<p>One of my favorite things is K-pop, I really like the music that some of the artists create. My favorite band is Stray Kids because they have a more alternative style to their music, along with interesting music videos and an overall nice dynamic between the members. The culture of K-pop is more like a community within the fanbases of many of the groups. I also feel like it's a good way to bring people of differing backgrounds together because there are fans that have made friends from all over the world due to their interest in certain bands. </p>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>Another of my favorite things would have to be cooking. I really enjoy making new kinds of dishes for my family, and recreating dishes I've seen on the internet. I really like to make a lot of Hispanic and Korean food. I make two dishes in particular pretty frequently because they're always asked for, which would be Taquitos and Kimchi Jigae. Taquitos are basically small rolled up tacos that I deep fry, and Kimchi Jigae is a Korean stew made with kimchi and pork belly and various seasonings, usually served with rice.</p>

    <h3>Tiktok</h3>
<p>I like Tiktok. It seems pretty self-explanitory but other than the obvious funny videos I see, it helps give me ideas on what to cook and stay moderately updated on things going on in the world. I do admit that I spend quite a bit of time scrolling, but I find that it is a good resource for me when it comes to certrain things. I use it for tips on cleaning, pet care, clothing and cooking, as well as recommendations for music, new anime shows, and new small brands and companies.</p>
